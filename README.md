# utilities
This repository if for the many miscellaneous small programs that I write for
my own convenience. Sometimes they're reusable, sometimes I need them for a long
time, and sometimes they're one-offs. But in any case, they usually contain techniques
that I'll need again, so I keep them here as samples for myself.

## Projects
- zoom-greenscreen. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself attending lots of
meetings and teaching via Zoom. Zoom has a background-image feature that's fun to
play with, and one of the related preferences is to clip your desired background
image to a greenscreen. So I bought some greenscreen fabric, put it in a picture
frame, and hung it on my office wall. This program packages a bunch of imagemagick
commands to let me easily scale and translate images and captions so I can use them
as Zoom backgrounds that show up in the frame behind me. Let the stupid jokes
commence.

- blah blah more to come
